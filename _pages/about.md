I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Raghupathy Sivakumar](https://siva.ece.gatech.edu/). I work with the [Georgia Tech Networks and Mobile Computing](http://www.gnan.ece.gatech.edu/) research group in the areas of edge computing, predictive caching and machine learning. In 2015, I received my Masters in Electronic Engineering from the [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/), South Africa, under the supervision of [Prof. Sunil Maharaj](https://www.up.ac.za/eece/article/1952219/prof-btj-maharaj-sunil) and [Prof. Attahiru Alfa](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~alfa/index.html). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering also from the University of Pretoria in 2013.
