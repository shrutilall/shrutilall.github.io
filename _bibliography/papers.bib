  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  author={Lall, Shruti and Sivakumar, Raghupathy},
  journal={ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing},
  year={2021},
  abstract={Internet traffic load is not uniformly distributed through the day; it
is significantly higher during peak-periods, and comparatively idle
during off-peak periods. In this context, we present CacheFlix, a
time-shifted edge-caching solution that prefetches Netflix content
during off-peak periods of network connectivity. We specifically
focus on Netflix since it contributes to the largest percentage of
global Internet traffic by a single application. We analyze a realworld
dataset of Netflix viewing activity that we collected from 1060
users spanning a 1-year period and comprised of over 2.2 million
Netflix TV shows and documentary series; we restrict the scope of
our study to Netflix series that account for 65% of a typical user’s
Netflix load in terms of bytes fetched. We present insights on users’
viewing behavior, and develop an accurate and efficient prediction
algorithm using LSTM networks that caches episodes of Netflix
series on storage constrained edge nodes, based on the user’s past
viewing activity. We evaluate CacheFlix on the collected dataset
over various cache eviction policies, and find that CacheFlix is able
to shift 70% of Netflix series traffic to off-peak hours}

  abstract={Netflix is the most popular video streaming site
contributing to nearly a quarter of global video traffic. Given
the dominance of Netflix on Internet traffic, understanding how
individual users consume content on Netflix is of interest to
not only the research community, but to network operators,

episodes and movies. We group the users based on their activity
level, and provide key insights pertaining to the user’s watch
patterns, watch-session length, user preferences, predictability
and watch-behavior continuation tendencies. We also implement
and evaluate classifiers which are used to predict the user’s
engagement in a series based on their past behavioral patterns.}

  abstract={YouTube is the most popular video sharing platform with more than 2 billion active users and 1 billion hours of video content watched daily. The dominance of YouTube has had a big impact on the performance of Internet protocols, algorithms, and systems. Understanding the interaction of users with YouTube is thus of much interest to the research community. In this context, we collect YouTube watch history data from 243 users spanning a 1.5 year period. The dataset comprises of a total of 1.8 million videos. We use the dataset to analyze and present key insights about user-level usage behavior. We also show that our analysis can be used by researchers to tackle a myriad of problems in the general domains of networking and communication. We present baseline characteristics and also substantiated directions to solve a few representative problems related to local caching techniques, prefetching strategies, the performance of YouTube's recommendation engine, the variability of user's video preferences and application specific load provisioning.}

  abstract={The position of an access point (AP) in a WiFi network has considerable influence on the performance of the network. In this work, we consider the problem of a WiFi AP self-positioning itself adaptively based on the network conditions to deliver improved network performance. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show that there are indeed significant performance benefits to be attained by allowing the AP to move intelligently. We also rely on theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental studies to show that the AP optimal location search problem can be split into two parts{:} a macro-search problem to minimize average path loss between AP and clients, and a micro-search problem to tackle real-time multipath fading effects. We then present Hermes, a self-positioning WiFi AP system that relies on a suite of algorithms to compute and then move to an optimal location within the network. Using a prototype implementation, we show that Hermes can perform up to 117% better than WiFi with no AP mobility, and up to 73% better than related work that allows for AP mobility.}

  abstract={The position of a wireless access point (AP) in wireless networks has been found to have a considerable impact on the overall network performance in indoor scenarios. Recent work has investigated the impact of the AP's location on the received signal strength of clients [1], and has shown that a 1:7x throughput improvement can be achieved by simply moving the AP in a 2ft. x 2ft. region. The benefits of small scale AP mobility is chiefly caused by mitigating multipath effects. In fact, the multipath effect has a significant impact on network performance and can be dramatically altered even with mere centimeter level movement of a Tx or a Rx. In this work, we investigate how network throughput performance can be improved if the AP is able to adapt its orientation. We consider two types of orientation changes - that of the AP's base platform (base orientation), and that of its antennas (antenna orientation). We show using experimental analysis that network throughput performance can be improved 1:8x by simply adapting AP's orientation.}

A novel data-driven intelligent system utilising artificial neural networks is proposed and developed for wildfire risk assessment for the City of Cape Town. The model uses vegetation, climate and location features to predict a rating corresponding to the risk of wildfire ignition for two different vegetation types. The system is trained and tested on historical fire incidence data from 2009-2015 and produces categorical outputs of low, moderate, high and extreme. Overall, the system is able to perform with an accuracy of up to 0.97 with a precision of 0.87 and a recall of 0.88.}

  abstract={For about the past decade and a half research efforts into cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have increased dramatically. This is because CRN is recognized as a technology that has the potential to squeeze the most out of the existing spectrum and hence virtually increase the effective capacity of a wireless communication system. The resulting increased capacity is still a limited resource and its optimal allocation is a critical requirement in order to realize its full benefits. Allocating these additional resources to the secondary users (SUs) in a CRN is an extremely challenging task and integer programming based optimization tools have to be employed to achieve the goals which include, among several aspects, increasing SUs throughput without interfering with the activities of primary users. The theory of the optimization tools that can be used for resource allocations (RA) in CRN have been well established in the literature; convex programming is one of them, in fact the major one. However when it comes to application and implementation, it is noticed that the practical problems do not fit exactly into the format of well established tools and researchers have to apply approximations of different forms to assist in the process. In this survey paper, the optimization tools that have been applied to RA in CRNs are reviewed. In some instances the limitations of techniques used are pointed out and creative tools developed by researchers to solve the problems are identified. Some ideas of tools to be considered by researchers are suggested, and direction for future research in this area in order to improve on the existing tools are presented.}

  abstract={Most research on the mathematical modelling of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have focussed mainly on the optimization aspects, such as those relating to sensor placements, data routing, reliability, etc. Surprisingly the issue relating to performance analysis of data processing and transmission at the nodes, have not received as much attention. A considerable amount of delay to data actually happens at the nodes as a result of queue build up. Hence, understanding the role of queueing in WSN modelling is very important. In this paper we study the literature of queueing as applied to WSNs and provide insight to the current state of the art and directions for the future. The utilization of queueing theory in WSNs is broadly classified into four categories, namely, congestion control methods, power allocation schemes, network performance evaluation techniques and scheduling schemes.}

  abstract={Disrupting network communication of adversarial networks is of increasing interest and importance. Theuse of jamming devices is a viable method for disabling the communication capabilities of enemy net-works. This paper proposes a jamming technique which targets the periodic nature of the routing pro-tocol residing in the network layer. The technique is based on the concept of null-frequency jammingwhich refers to periodic attacks targeting specific protocol period/frequency of operation. The effects ofthis jamming technique are investigated in stack, half-diamond, full-diamond, full-mesh and randomtopologies employing the optimised link state routing protocol. OMNeTþþ4.3 was chosen as thenetwork simulation platform in which to conduct the investigations. It was found that when jamming atthe 2 s null-period for a length of 0.5 s, there was a substantial drop in overall network performance. Thistechnique was then compared to constant, deceptive and random jamming techniques and was shown to outperform the techniques in terms of the energy expended by the wireless nodes in the networks.}

  abstract={A novel physical-layer based security method that utilizes jammers to generate additional interference for devices that are eavesdropping on wireless network communication is proposed. The scheme involves the intelligent placement of continuous jammers in order to achieve maximum protection and data confidentiality for wireless mesh networks with multiple eavesdroppers, sources and destinations. Furthermore, the scheme is optimized in terms of the transmitting power associated with each jammer so that the energy expended by the jammers is kept at a minimum. The protection scheme precludes the use of any cryptographic techniques and is only physical layer based. The security method is modeled as a minimization mixed integer non-linear problem and is approximated as the sequential solution of two linear optimization sub-problems relating to the placement and power allocation of the wireless jammers. The placement of the jammers takes the form of a multiple demand multidimensional knapsack problem with a minimization objective. The power allocation problem is modeled as a linear real-valued minimization optimization problem. The performance of the proposed security method is evaluated through appropriate simulations conducted on random network instances.}
